## ðŸš€ About Me

Iâ€™m a software developer from Colombia ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡´ with a strong focus on, building scalable systems for startups and established businesses.  
I enjoy working on backend-heavy projects, cloud infrastructure, and also crafting frontend experiences when needed.

Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to:
- Lead development of SaaS products from scratch to production.  
- Work with teams across various tech stacks.  
- Deliver reliable solutions in **IoT**, **corporate training systems**, and **B2B SaaS**. 

You can check some of my **[projects here](projects.md)** or check it out on my **[GitHub](https://github.com/andresmauro17)**.


## âœ¨ Beyond Code

I co-founded **[Ingenialo Industrias](https://ingenialo.com)**, a community promoting hardware & software learning in Spanish-speaking countries. I also enjoy exploring new tech ideas, mentoring early-stage devs, and working on entrepreneurial projects.
